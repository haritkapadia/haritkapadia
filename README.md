Hi! My name is Harit. I'm seeking Winter 2024 opportunities.

I am a full stack developer experienced in technical design, end-to-end development, and serverless deployment.

I'm currently working on [I Spy Notify](https://github.com/i-spy-notify), a Linux tool that watches desktop notifications and runs scripts for each notification.

If you want to share anything about compilers, functional languages, language embedding or interoperability, or Linux news, I'd love to talk to you about it!

You can reach me by email at haritkapadia@outlook.com.
